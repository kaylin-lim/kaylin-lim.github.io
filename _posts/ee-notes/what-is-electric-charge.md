Electric charge is one of the most fundamental concepts in electrical engineering,
yet it is also one of the most abstract.
Unlike voltage or current, charge is not something we directly measure in everyday circuits.
Instead, we observe its effects.

At its core, electric charge is a property of matter.
Just as mass determines how an object responds to gravity,
charge determines how particles interact through electromagnetic forces.
Charge itself is not energy, nor is it a form of current.
It simply exists as an inherent characteristic of particles.

There are two types of electric charge: positive and negative.
Particles with the same type of charge repel each other,
while particles with opposite charges attract.
This behavior is fundamental and does not require a deeper explanation.
It is a basic rule of nature that all electrical systems rely on.

In practical electrical systems, electrons play the most important role.
Electrons carry negative charge and are relatively free to move within conductors.
Protons, which carry positive charge, are bound tightly inside atomic nuclei
and do not move freely under normal conditions.
As a result, most electrical phenomena in circuits
can be understood by tracking the motion and distribution of electrons.

Electric charge by itself does not cause anything to happen.
A stationary distribution of charge may create an electric field,
but without movement, there is no current and no energy transfer.
However, once charge begins to move,
it becomes the foundation for all dynamic electrical behavior.

Understanding electric charge is the first step toward understanding
current, voltage, electric fields, and ultimately all electronic systems.
Without charge, none of the concepts that follow in electrical engineering
would have any physical meaning.
