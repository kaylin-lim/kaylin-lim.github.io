Electric current describes the flow of electric charge over time.
Although current is one of the most commonly used terms in electrical engineering,
it is often misunderstood as energy or power.
In reality, current is neither of these.

At a basic level, current measures how much electric charge passes through a point
in a circuit per unit time.
It is a rate, not a substance.
Saying that a circuit has a large current simply means
that charge is moving through it quickly.

One common source of confusion is the direction of current.
By convention, current is defined as flowing from positive to negative.
However, in most conductive materials, electrons—which carry negative charge—
actually move in the opposite direction.
This apparent contradiction is purely historical
and does not affect circuit analysis or physical understanding.

Current cannot exist without a closed path.
If there is no continuous loop for charge to move through,
electrons will accumulate and the flow will stop.
This is why circuits must be complete for devices to operate.
The requirement of a closed path naturally introduces the concept of a circuit.

The importance of current lies in its physical effects.
Flowing charge generates heat in resistive materials,
creates magnetic fields around conductors,
and enables devices such as LEDs, motors, and processors to function.
While voltage provides the potential for action,
it is current that produces observable effects.

If electric charge is the static foundation of electrical systems,
current is what brings those systems to life.
Understanding current allows us to explain
how energy is transferred and controlled in real circuits.
